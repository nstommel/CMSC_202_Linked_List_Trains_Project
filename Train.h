  //    2. Business Class
  //    3. Coach
  //    4. Sleeping Cars

  //    Snack Car 
  //       a. If the train has both Business Class and Coach, the Snack Car
  //          must be placed between coach and business.
  //       b. If the train has no Business Class, then the Snack Car must
  //          be placed in the middle of the Coach cars; if there is an 
  //          odd number of Coach cars, it should be placed closer to the
  //          locomotive.

  //       a. A train has a Dining Car if and only if it has one or more
  //          sleeping cars.  The Dining Car should be placed between the
  //          coach cars and the sleeping cars.
